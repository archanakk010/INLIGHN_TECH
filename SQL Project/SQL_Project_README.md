## 1. Overview of Problem Statement
The SQL project is focused on analyzing data from a music store database (Chinook dataset).  
The goal is to practice SQL querying skills, extract meaningful insights, and answer critical business questions.  
The project demonstrates database management, data retrieval, and analytical problem-solving using SQL.

## 2. Objective
The main objective of this project is to query the database to solve real-world business problems, such as identifying top customers, analyzing sales performance, and exploring employee hierarchies.  
It also aims to showcase proficiency in SQL commands such as `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`.

## 3. Dataset
The project uses the **Chinook Database**, a sample dataset that contains information about a digital music store.  
It includes tables such as **Employee, Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, Album, Artist, and Genre**.

## 4. Methodology
- **SQL Queries:** Extracted relevant business information.  
- **Aggregations:** Used functions like COUNT, SUM, MAX, and MIN.  
- **Joins:** Combined multiple tables for deeper insights.  
- **Sorting/Filtering:** Used `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and `WHERE` clauses.  
- **Presentation:** Structured results for easy interpretation.  

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key business questions explored through SQL queries:
- Who is the senior-most employee based on job title and levels?  
- Which countries have the highest number of invoices?  
- What are the top 3 invoices with the highest total amounts?  
- Which city generated the highest total revenue?  
- Who are the top 5 customers in terms of spending?  

## 6. Results
- The senior-most employee in the database was identified.  
- The USA had the highest number of invoices.  
- The top 3 invoices had the maximum revenue.  
- Prague generated the highest total revenue.  
- Top 5 customers were identified based on spending.  

## 7. Limitations
- The Chinook dataset is a **sample database**, not real-world data.  
- Limited in scope and time period.  
- External data sources not included.  

## 8. Conclusion
The project demonstrated how SQL can be used to analyze structured datasets and extract insights.  
It strengthened understanding of SQL commands, relationships between tables, and business analysis.  

## 9. Future Work
- Extend analysis with advanced SQL queries like **nested queries** and **window functions**.  
- Build visual dashboards in **Power BI/Tableau** from SQL outputs.  
- Optimize SQL queries for better performance.  
- Integrate with **Python** for advanced analytics and automation.
